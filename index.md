*A little about me; I am currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at the University of Southern California. My interests include Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Software Engineering. When I am not writing code, you will find me playing football, video games, hiking in Islamabad's Margalla Hills (pictured above) or helping my brother with his startup. I will try to keep this site updated with happenings across my personal life and my professional career.*

You can check about my different projects on my [projects page](https://qaiis.github.io/projects/)
