*A little about me; I am currently employed at Quantum Analytica where I work as a Machine Learning Engineer (Jr.). My interests include Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and their applicability in the autonomous vehicles domain. When I am not writing code, you will find me playing football, video games, hiking in Islamabad's Margalla Hills, or helping my brother with his startup. I will try to keep this site updated with happenings across my personal life and my professional career.*

You can check about my different projects on my [projects page](https://qaiis.github.io/projects/)
