## Introduction

A mobile app I made in the summer of 2018, which allows management of assets on a single platform. I plan to document my journey in a blog on how I got into crypto, this app and why I eventually got out early.


## Highlights
- A cryptocurrency exchange aggegator which allows management of assests from exchanges such as Bittrex, Binance and
- Kraken on a single platform.
- Shows real-time exchange asset prices, ability to book an order, and buy/sell an order.
- Implemented news feed with cryptocurrency related news articles and social media updates of exchanges.
