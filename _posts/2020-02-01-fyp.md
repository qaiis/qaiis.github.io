## Introduction

I've always been fascinated by autonomous vehicles, from watching DARPA Grand Challenge videos on the internet to reading articles on their workings. I took an AI class at Air University in the sixth semester, which exposed me to Reinforcement Learning and piqued my attention. I had to submit a proposal for my Final-Year Project that same semester. Despite the fact that I was leaning toward building a webapp in Django and had half-completed my proposal, I decided to switch gears and combine my enthusiasm for AVs with my newfound interest in Reinforcement Learning, resulting in this project. My grade suffered that semester, however, for Final-Year Project II and III, my team scored the highest grade and got selected for presentation at Open House 2019 infront of the Vice-Chancellor and various companies.

## Highlights

- **Led a group of three in assessing and evaluating performance of Deep Q-Network and Double Deep Q-Network in OpenAI gymâ€™s CarRacing-v0 environment.**
- **Responsible for conducting research on relevant subject matter, setting timelines, and handing out reading material.**
- **Implemented using Python and TensorFlow, measured and observed performance using average Q-values and average reward values.**
- **Wrote a report detailing background, findings, performance, implementation details and presented findings to a panel of professors.**
- **Recognized and selected among several projects for presentation at Air University Open House 2019.**
